## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this process I learnt more about how to structure basic html tree. I also rienforced more my knowledge about implementing the correct css workflows. I still need to figure out how correctly place an offset background image so thaat it does not move when resizing the page as can be seen with the top right main image.

### Continued development

I will start my next project by implementing some Javascript to help animate the page and bring it to life with intuitive functionality.
